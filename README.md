**The Problem:** Addressing Food Insecurity and Resource Waste on Campus


Food insecurity is a significant issue among students. With the end of SNAP benefits for many, the need for free food resources is more apparent than ever.

Our project addresses two interconnected challenges:

**1. Underutilized Food Resources**
-Clubs and Organizations frequently host events with leftover food that needs a better outreach system to reach students who could use it.
-Local Businesses often have surplus food that goes to waste instead of being redistributed.

**2. Inefficient Dining Dollar Sharing** 
Many students run out of dining dollars weeks before the semester ends, while others have a surplus that ultimately goes to waste.

The current system for sharing meals is fragmented, students resort to anonymous social networks like Yik Yak to request meals, leading to slow, unorganized, and inefficient fulfillment. We aim to take this successful student-created solution and make it official and efficient.

**How We Address It:** The New Paltz Pantry WebApp


Our web application is designed to be the central hub that streamlines connections between students in need and available food resources.

**Key Features
1. The Free Food Feed (Resource Sharing)**
Flexible Accounts: Users can sign up as an Individual, a Club/Organization, or a Local Business.

Easy Posting: Anyone can create a post detailing available food, including the location and a custom message describing what's available (e.g., "Leftover pizza from 6 PM event," "Box of pastries available until 1 PM").

Real-Time Access: The main feed displays posts with the most recent at the top, ensuring students see timely, relevant opportunities.

2. The Meal Request Feed (Dining Dollar Sharing)
Anonymous Requests: Students can anonymously post requests for a specific meal from an on-campus dining location that accepts dining dollars.
Time-Sensitive: Posts will automatically expire after a specified time (e.g., one hour) to ensure requests are only fulfilled at a reasonable time.
Efficient Fulfillment: A student with a dining dollar surplus can respond to fulfill the request. They will have a dedicated space to upload a screenshot confirming the order and the order number/waiting time, allowing the requesting student to pick up the meal seamlessly.
